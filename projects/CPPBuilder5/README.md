# Source directory for the CPPBuilder5 tutorial project

## Instructions for the Borland free c++ compiler 

* The download is still available at http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20633/
* run the installer - accept the default folder _C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin_ if you possibly can
* in a command prompt cd to <Catch checkout>\projects\CPPBuilder5
* _important_ you will probably *have* to run the environment setup script:
  * bccenv.bat
* run _make -f Tutorial.mak_
* Tutorial1.exe should be built in the current dir   
  
  
## Instructions for c++ Builder
* install c++ builder - I assume the default location on 32-bit Windows and _C:\CBuilder5\bin_ on 64-bit Windows
* in a command prompt cd to <Catch checkout>\projects\CPPBuilder5
* _important_ you will probably *have* to run the environment setup script:
  * bcbenv.bat
* building is simply run _make_
* Tutorial1.exe should be built in the current dir
